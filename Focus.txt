The question you asked has very wide scope for answer. I will suggest to focus on things which are in your resume â€¦ obviously.
Next thing, focus on design patterns. Prepare 3-4 patterns perfectly. Be prepared to give real life examples, how you use them in your previous projects. They will certainly ask this question.
Next, learn each and every detail about your current project. System design, module designs, database structure.. and what benefit they provided overall. Keep everything on finger tips.
Learn and practice multi-threading (specially executors and thread pools). Create some programs on paper. Practice them.
Try out writing some tricky SQL queries etc. Read about joins, indexes and their syntax.
OOPs concepts are expected from you as well. Prepare your own definition and memorize it.
I think, rest of the things will be technologies which you will mention in your resume.
